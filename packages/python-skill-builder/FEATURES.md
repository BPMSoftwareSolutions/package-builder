## Known Issues & Limitations

### Resolved
- ✅ Sandbox was too restrictive (blocked Attribute, Try, Raise) - FIXED
- ✅ Missing workshop navigation - FIXED
- ✅ Code not persisted between sessions - FIXED

### Current Limitations (By Design)
- No user authentication (localStorage is browser-specific)
- No server-side progress tracking
- No multi-user support
- No code sharing or collaboration
- No detailed analytics or reporting
- Limited to Python code execution
- NumPy not actually available in sandbox (workshops simulate it)

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope for #24)

### Phase 2 Considerations (Issue #25 - Reflexive AI)
- [ ] AI-powered performance analysis
- [ ] Adaptive curriculum generation
- [ ] Gap detection and targeted exercises
- [ ] Skill fingerprint reports
- [ ] Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- [ ] Personalized learning paths

### Other Potential Features
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting (CodeMirror/Monaco)
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Export progress reports
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Achievements/badges
- [ ] Code review and best practices feedback
- [ ] Video tutorials integration
- [ ] Community solutions sharing

2. Users can write, submit, and grade code
3. Progress is tracked and persisted
4. Code is saved and restored automatically
5. Navigation works between workshops
6. All tests pass (test_app.py)
7. Documentation is complete
8. Code is committed with proper issue references

---

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (as of commit 4641dcd + pending code persistence commit)

**Next Steps:** 
- Commit code persistence feature
- Manual QA testing
- Consider starting Issue #25 (Reflexive AI Education)
