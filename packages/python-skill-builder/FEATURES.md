## Alternative Implementations Feature

### Overview
Workshops can now offer **multiple approaches** to solving the same problem, allowing learners to:
- Compare different implementation strategies (e.g., list comprehension vs. for-loop)
- Learn multiple patterns for the same task
- Choose their preferred learning style
- Complete a workshop by mastering ANY one approach

### Implementation Details

**JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "basics_01",
  "title": "Even Squares",
  "prompt": "...",
  "approaches": [
    {
      "id": "comprehension",
      "title": "List Comprehension",
      "description": "Use Python's concise list comprehension syntax",
      "starterCode": "...",
      "hints": ["..."],
      "tests": "..."
    },
    {
      "id": "loop",
      "title": "For Loop",
      "description": "Use traditional for-loop with append",
      "starterCode": "...",
      "hints": ["..."],
      "tests": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Completion Logic:**
- Workshop is **100% complete** when ANY approach scores >= 80%
- Module is **100% complete** when ALL workshops have at least one completed approach
- Users can attempt multiple approaches for deeper learning
- Each approach has its own hints, starter code, and validation tests

**Progress Tracking:**
```javascript
{
  "python_basics": {
    "scores": { "basics_01": 100 },  // Highest score across all approaches
    "approachScores": {
      "basics_01": {
        "comprehension": 100,
        "loop": 85
      }
    },
    "code": {
      "basics_01": {
        "comprehension": "def even_squares(nums):\n    return [n**2 for n in nums if n % 2 == 0]",
        "loop": "def even_squares(nums):\n    result = []\n    for n in nums:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            result.append(n**2)\n    return result"
      }
    },
    "approaches": { "basics_01": "comprehension" }  // Last selected approach
  }
}
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Resolved

- ✅ Missing workshop navigation - FIXED
- ✅ Code not persisted between sessions - FIXED

### Current Limitations (By Design)
- No user authentication (localStorage is browser-specific)
- No server-side progress tracking
- No multi-user support
- No code sharing or collaboration
- No detailed analytics or reporting
- Limited to Python code execution
- NumPy not actually available in sandbox (workshops simulate it)
