# RenderX Mono-Repo Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the RenderX Mono-Repo consolidation project (Issue #134).

## Phase 1: Scaffold + Copy Patterns ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Create `/packages/renderx-mono-repo` directory structure
- [x] Copy ESLint configuration from renderx-plugins-demo (25+ rules)
- [x] Copy artifact generation scripts from renderx-plugins-demo
- [x] Set up `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with all packages
- [x] Create root `tsconfig.json` with project references
- [x] Create `CODEOWNERS` file
- [x] Create `renderx-adf.json` with context definitions
- [x] Set up Turbo configuration for multi-package builds
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow for workspace validation
- [x] Verify ESLint and TypeScript configuration works

### Deliverables

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Workspace configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - Root TypeScript configuration with project references
- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint with boundary enforcement rules
- `turbo.json` - Turbo build orchestration
- `renderx-adf.json` - Architectural Definition File
- `package.json` - Root package configuration
- `CODEOWNERS` - Team ownership assignments
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `README.md` - Getting started guide
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture documentation
- `docs/BOUNDARIES.md` - Boundary enforcement rules
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contributing guidelines
- `.github/workflows/validate-workspace.yml` - CI/CD validation workflow

## Phase 2: Consolidate All 10 Packages ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Create `packages/conductor/` directory structure
- [x] Create `packages/sdk/` directory structure
- [x] Create `packages/manifest-tools/` directory structure
- [x] Create `packages/host-sdk/` directory structure
- [x] Create `packages/shell/` directory structure
- [x] Create `packages/contracts/` directory structure
- [x] Create `packages/tooling/` directory structure
- [x] Create `packages/plugins/` directory structure
- [x] Create all 7 plugin packages:
  - [x] Canvas plugin
  - [x] Canvas component plugin
  - [x] Components plugin
  - [x] Control panel plugin
  - [x] Header plugin
  - [x] Library plugin
  - [x] Library component plugin

### Deliverables

Each package includes:
- `package.json` - Package configuration with proper exports
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with project references
- `src/index.ts` - Stub implementation (to be populated with actual code)

### Package Structure

```

├── packages/
│   ├── conductor/
│   ├── sdk/
│   ├── manifest-tools/
│   ├── host-sdk/
│   ├── shell/

```

## Phase 3: Enable Boundaries & Guardrails 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Tasks

- [ ] Enable ESLint boundary rules (already copied from renderx-plugins-demo)
- [ ] Turn on ESLint module boundaries in "error" mode
- [ ] Enable TypeScript project references
- [ ] Configure CODEOWNERS for required reviews
- [ ] Create CI check for artifact integrity
- [ ] Create CI check for manifest validation
- [ ] Create CI check for orchestration sequences
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Get green builds locally and in CI

### Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd packages/renderx-mono-repo
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Verify Workspace**
   ```bash
   pnpm run lint
   pnpm run typecheck
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   pnpm run test
   ```

4. **Build All Packages**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

## Boundary Enforcement Status

### ESLint Rules

- ✅ Plugin boundary rules configured
- ✅ Shell boundary rules configured
- ✅ Conductor boundary rules configured
- ⏳ Rules enabled in "warn" mode (will be "error" in Phase 3)

### TypeScript Project References

- ✅ Root `tsconfig.json` with all package references
- ✅ Each package has `tsconfig.json` with `composite: true`
- ⏳ References need to be validated during build

### No Deep Imports Policy

- ✅ Each package has `"exports"` field
- ✅ ESLint rules prevent deep imports
- ⏳ Validation during CI/CD

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Each package has `test` script configured
- Tests run via Vitest
- Coverage threshold: 80%+

### Integration Tests

- Cross-package interaction tests (to be added)
- Plugin-conductor communication tests (to be added)
- Orchestration sequence tests (to be added)

### Boundary Tests

- ESLint catches illegal imports
- TypeScript catches boundary violations
- CI fails on violations

## Documentation

### Completed

- [x] `README.md` - Getting started guide
- [x] `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture overview
- [x] `BOUNDARIES.md` - Boundary enforcement rules
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contributing guidelines

### Pending

- [ ] `PACKAGES.md` - Overview of each package
- [ ] `ORCHESTRATION.md` - Guide to symphonies, movements, beats
- [ ] `ARTIFACTS.md` - Artifact generation and integrity
- [ ] `MIGRATION.md` - Step-by-step migration guide
