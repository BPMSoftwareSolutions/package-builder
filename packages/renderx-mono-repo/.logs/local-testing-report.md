## Conclusion

✅ **LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

All development workflows are working correctly:
- ✅ Dependencies install without issues
- ✅ All packages build successfully
- ✅ All packages pass linting
- ✅ All packages pass type checking
- ✅ All packages pass tests
- ✅ Development mode works with file watching

The RenderX Mono-Repo is ready for local development and can be used for:
- Building packages
- Running tests
- Linting code
- Type checking
- Development with file watching

## Next Steps

1. **Local Development**: Run `pnpm run dev` to start development mode
2. **Make Changes**: Edit TypeScript files in any package
3. **Watch Mode**: Conductor will automatically recompile on file changes
4. **Build for Production**: Run `pnpm run build` to build all packages
5. **Docker Deployment**: Use `docker-compose up` to run in containers
