# CI/CD Pipeline Fixes Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-21 12:35 UTC
**Status**: ✅ ALL FIXES APPLIED AND VERIFIED

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Guardrails Check Failing on renderx-mono-repo
**Severity**: High
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

#### Problem
The CI/CD pipeline was failing at the "🛡️ Guardrails Check (G6)" step because:
- renderx-mono-repo is excluded from npm workspaces (line 9 in root package.json)
- But the guardrails script was still scanning all directories in `packages/`
- renderx-mono-repo doesn't have the required package structure (it's a monorepo, not a package)
- Guardrails validation failed because it expected `src/`, `test/`, `README.md`, etc.

#### Solution
Modified `scripts/pb-guardrails.ts` to exclude renderx-mono-repo from validation:
```typescript
// Before
const packageDirs = entries
  .filter(entry => entry.isDirectory())
  .map(entry => join(packagesDir, entry.name));

// After
const packageDirs = entries
  .filter(entry => entry.isDirectory() && entry.name !== 'renderx-mono-repo')
  .map(entry => join(packagesDir, entry.name));
```

#### Commit
```
fix: Exclude renderx-mono-repo from guardrails validation
- renderx-mono-repo is a monorepo, not a package, so it doesn't meet package guardrails requirements
- Add filter to skip renderx-mono-repo directory in guardrails check
- Fixes CI/CD pipeline failure on Phase 7 commits
```

### Issue 2: TypeScript Declarations Not Generated in repo-dashboard
**Severity**: High
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

#### Problem
The guardrails check was failing for repo-dashboard because:
- TypeScript was generating `.d.ts.map` files but not `.d.ts` files
- The `composite: true` flag in root tsconfig.json was preventing declaration generation
- Package exports expected `dist/index.d.ts` but it didn't exist

#### Solution
Modified `packages/repo-dashboard/tsconfig.json` to disable composite mode:
```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "composite": false  // ← Added this
  },
  ...
}
```

#### Commit
```
fix: Fix TypeScript declaration generation in repo-dashboard
- Set composite: false in repo-dashboard/tsconfig.json to enable .d.ts generation
- The composite flag was preventing TypeScript from generating declaration files
- Now all .d.ts files are properly generated during build
- Guardrails check now passes for all packages
```
