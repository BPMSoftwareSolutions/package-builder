# ADF Compliance Audit - Architecture-First Dashboard

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE - 6 of 12 pages/endpoints non-compliant  
**Priority:** HIGH - Must filter all data to ADF repos only

---

## Executive Summary

The dashboard has **mixed compliance** with the architecture-first design principle. Some pages correctly filter data to only renderx-plugins-demo ADF repositories, while others fetch **ALL organization repositories**.

**Non-Compliant Pages:** 6  
**Compliant Pages:** 6  
**Compliance Rate:** 50%

## 🟢 COMPLIANT - Filtering by ADF Repos

### 1. **Home Dashboard** (`/api/summary/architecture/:org/:repo`)
- ✅ Filters to ADF repositories only
- ✅ Shows architecture-aware summary
- ✅ Displays containers from C4 model
- ✅ Drill-down to Conductor Logs

### 2. **Repo Status (Architecture Mode)** (`/api/repos/architecture/:org/:repo`)
- ✅ Filters to ADF repositories only
- ✅ Shows only repos defined in ADF
- ✅ Displays team-specific metrics
- ✅ Respects `isArchitectureMode` flag

### 3. **Architecture Dashboard** (C4 Model)
- ✅ Loads from ADF file
- ✅ Shows containers and relationships
- ✅ Displays team mappings
- ✅ Component-level drill-down

### 4. **Conductor Logs Monitoring** (`/api/conductor/logs`)
- ✅ Filters to ADF repositories
- ✅ Shows container health
- ✅ Displays metrics from logs
- ✅ Architecture-specific data

### 5. **Metrics Aggregator** (`/api/metrics/aggregated`)
- ✅ Pulls from ADF repos only
- ✅ Aggregates team-specific metrics
- ✅ Respects architecture context
- ✅ Caches results

### 6. **Three Ways Framework** (Flow, Feedback, Learning)
- ✅ Uses ADF-filtered repos
- ✅ Shows architecture-specific metrics
- ✅ Displays team collaboration data
- ✅ Respects architecture boundaries

## 🔴 NON-COMPLIANT - Fetching ALL Org Repos

### 1. **Repo Status (Default Mode)** (`/api/repos/:org`)
```
❌ ISSUE: Fetches ALL organization repositories
📍 Location: packages/repo-dashboard/src/server.ts:396-448
🔗 Endpoint: GET /api/repos/:org
📊 Impact: Shows 50+ repos instead of 5-6 ADF repos
```

**Current Behavior:**
```typescript
const repos = await listRepos({
  org,
  limit: Math.min(parseInt(limit as string), 100)
});
// Returns ALL org repos, not filtered by ADF
```

**Should Be:**
```typescript
// Load ADF and extract repos
const adf = loadLocalADF('renderx-plugins-demo-adf.json');
const architectureRepos = extractRepositoriesFromADF(adf, org);
// Return only ADF repos
```

---

### 2. **Issues Page** (`/api/repos/:owner/:repo/issues`)
```
❌ ISSUE: Accepts any repo, not validated against ADF
📍 Location: packages/repo-dashboard/src/web/pages/Issues.tsx:20-60
🔗 Endpoint: GET /api/repos/:owner/:repo/issues
📊 Impact: Can view issues from ANY repo, not just ADF repos
```

**Current Behavior:**
```typescript
const [owner, repoName] = repo.split('/');
const response = await fetch(`/api/repos/${owner}/${repoName}/issues?state=${state}`);
// No validation that repo is in ADF
```

---

### 3. **Packages Page** (`/api/packages`)
```
❌ ISSUE: Scans local filesystem, not ADF-aware
📍 Location: packages/repo-dashboard/src/web/pages/Packages.tsx:29-58
🔗 Endpoint: GET /api/packages
📊 Impact: Shows all local packages, not ADF-specific packages
```

**Current Behavior:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/packages?basePath=${encodeURIComponent(basePath)}`);
// Scans ./packages directory, not ADF-aware
```

---

### 4. **Build Status Endpoint** (`/api/build-status/:org/:repo`)
```
❌ ISSUE: Accepts any repo without ADF validation
📍 Location: packages/repo-dashboard/src/server.ts (build-status endpoint)
🔗 Endpoint: GET /api/build-status/:org/:repo
📊 Impact: Can fetch build status for ANY repo
```

---

### 5. **Test Results Endpoint** (`/api/test-results/:org/:repo`)
```
❌ ISSUE: Accepts any repo without ADF validation
📍 Location: packages/repo-dashboard/src/server.ts (test-results endpoint)
🔗 Endpoint: GET /api/test-results/:org/:repo
📊 Impact: Can fetch test results for ANY repo
```

---

### 6. **Deployment Status Endpoint** (`/api/deployment-status/:org/:repo`)
```
❌ ISSUE: Accepts any repo without ADF validation
📍 Location: packages/repo-dashboard/src/server.ts (deployment-status endpoint)
🔗 Endpoint: GET /api/deployment-status/:org/:repo
📊 Impact: Can fetch deployment status for ANY repo
```

## 🎯 Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Endpoint Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Add ADF validation to `/api/build-status/:org/:repo`
- [ ] Add ADF validation to `/api/test-results/:org/:repo`
- [ ] Add ADF validation to `/api/deployment-status/:org/:repo`
- [ ] Update `/api/repos/:org` to filter by ADF

### Phase 2: Page Updates (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Update Issues page to validate repo against ADF
- [ ] Add ADF context to Issues page
- [ ] Show "Not in Architecture" message for non-ADF repos

### Phase 3: Packages Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Make Packages page ADF-aware
- [ ] Filter packages to ADF repos only
- [ ] Show package readiness per ADF team

## 📍 ADF Repositories (Current)

The renderx-plugins-demo ADF defines these repositories:

1. `BPMSoftwareSolutions/renderx-plugins-demo` (Host Team)
2. `BPMSoftwareSolutions/renderx-plugins-sdk` (SDK Team)
3. `BPMSoftwareSolutions/renderx-manifest-tools` (SDK Team)
4. `BPMSoftwareSolutions/musical-conductor` (Conductor Team)
5. `BPMSoftwareSolutions/renderx-ux-components` (UX/UI Team)
6. `BPMSoftwareSolutions/renderx-control-panel` (Control Panel Team)

**All endpoints should ONLY return data for these 6 repositories.**
