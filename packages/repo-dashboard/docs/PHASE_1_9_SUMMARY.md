## üîπ 10 Flow Problems We're Solving

1. **Bottlenecks and Long Lead Times** ‚Üí Constraint Radar, Flow Stage Breakdown
2. **Large Batch Sizes** ‚Üí WIP Tracking, Batch Size Visualization
3. **Excessive Hand-offs** ‚Üí Handoff Tracking, Cross-Team Visualization
4. **Inconsistent Environments** ‚Üí Environment Configuration Dashboard
5. **Manual or Error-Prone Deployments** ‚Üí Deployment Status, Rollback Tracking
6. **Lack of Visibility into Flow** ‚Üí Value Stream Clock, PR Flow Breakdown
7. **Over-Specialization** ‚Üí Bus Factor Analysis, Code Ownership
8. **Unbalanced Workload (Too Much WIP)** ‚Üí WIP Limits, WIP Visualization
9. **Ignored Dependencies** ‚Üí Dependency Graph, CIA/SPA Gate Visualization
10. **Delayed Feedback Loops** ‚Üí Real-Time Alerts, Build Status, Test Results

## üîó Related Issues

- **#72**: Three Ways Framework Integration (grandparent)
- **#83**: Phase 1.8 Real-Time Feedback & Alerting (backend, completed)
- **#92**: Phase 1.9 (parent, this initiative)
- **#93-96**: Phase 1.9 sub-issues

## üí° Key Insights

### Why This Matters
- Backend is world-class (42 services, 531 tests)
- Frontend is severely underdeveloped (2.4% integration)
- Users cannot see the value of the backend investment
- This initiative closes the gap and delivers immediate user value

### Phased Approach
- Each phase delivers user value independently
- Can be deployed incrementally
- Allows for feedback and iteration
- Reduces risk of large monolithic changes

### Problem-Driven Design
- Each component solves specific flow problems
- Directly addresses pain points from The Phoenix Project
- Measurable impact on team performance
- Data-driven decision making
