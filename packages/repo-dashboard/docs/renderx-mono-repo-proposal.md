Here‚Äôs a proven, low-drama way to move RenderX into a mono-repo **without** losing your context boundaries.

### 1) Carve the repo into ‚Äúcontext packages‚Äù

* Create first-class packages for each bounded context (e.g., `@renderx/conductor`, `@renderx/spa-runtime`, `@renderx/valence`, `@renderx/shell`, `@renderx/plugins/<name>`, `@renderx/tooling/<name>`).
* Make every package publishable (even if `private: true`) and expose only a narrow API via `package.json` `"exports"` (no deep imports).
* Use workspaces (`pnpm`/`npm`/`yarn`) so all packages resolve locally but still behave like separate modules.

### 2) Enforce boundaries in code (lint + types + build)

* **ESLint module boundaries**: Add Nx‚Äôs `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` rule with tags like `scope:shell`, `scope:conductor`, `scope:plugin`, etc., and write dependency constraints (e.g., plugins cannot import the shell; shell can depend on plugin *interfaces* only). This catches illegal imports at dev time and in CI. ([Nx][1])
* **TypeScript project references**: Split tsconfig into per-package `composite` projects and wire them with **Project References**. That gives you fast, incremental builds *and* compile-time walls between packages. ([typescriptlang.org][2])
* **Build-system visibility (optional, advanced)**: If you use Bazel for parts of the graph, set `visibility` on targets (and `package_group`s) so only approved packages can depend on them‚Äîthis is a hard boundary at build time. ([Bazel][3])

### 3) Make boundaries part of the PR gate (ownership + CI)

* **CODEOWNERS**: Route changes in each context folder to its owning team (e.g., `/packages/conductor/ @orchestration-team`). This guarantees the right eyes review any cross-context changes. ([GitHub Docs][4])
* **CI checks**:

  * Run lint (module-boundaries) and type-checks on *affected* packages only.
  * Fail PRs on boundary violations (illegal import, deep import, missing export surface).
  * Generate a project graph and post a comment if a new edge crosses a forbidden boundary.

### 4) Keep UI/plugins decoupled the way you designed them

* Preserve your thin-shell + panel-slot plugin pattern by packaging the **shell** and each **slot UI** as separate packages, and ship **plugin manifests** as data. The shell depends on plugin *interfaces*; plugins depend on the **conductor** client only. (This keeps the UI surface thin and prevents shell‚áÑplugin tangles.)

### 5) Versioning & release hygiene that respects boundaries

* Use Changesets (or similar) so versions bump only where changes occur; restrict dependency ranges so downward edges don‚Äôt creep (e.g., plugins depend on `@renderx/conductor ^X.Y` but never the shell).
* For runtime contracts (sequence/handler shapes), keep them in shared **interface** packages; treat contract changes as semver-major and force review via CODEOWNERS.

### 6) A pragmatic migration plan (two weeks of disciplined steps)

1. **Scaffold** the mono-repo skeleton: `/packages/*`, workspaces, TS refs, ESLint base, CI workflow.
2. **Lift & shift** the *conductor* core first (lowest ripple), publish internal canary.
3. Move the **shell** next (thin wrapper), then **valence/tooling** packages.
4. Move **one plugin family at a time**. For each: create a package, define `"exports"`, fix deep imports.
5. Turn on **ESLint module boundaries** in ‚Äúwarn‚Äù mode, resolve violations, then flip to ‚Äúerror‚Äù. ([Nx][1])
6. Enable **TS project references**; get green builds locally, then in CI. ([typescriptlang.org][2])
7. Add **CODEOWNERS** and required reviews; land the switch on `main`. ([GitHub Docs][4])

### 7) Guardrails to prevent future drift

* **No deep imports** policy (enforced by ESLint + `"exports"`).
* **Public API checks**: a tiny script that fails CI if a package exports files outside `/src/public`.
* **Allowed-deps lists** per package (lint rule or custom check).
* **Cross-context test ban**: tests in one context can‚Äôt import helpers from another (use published test utils if needed).

### 8) Why mono-repo at all? (and the trade-offs)

A single repo improves discoverability, atomic changes, and shared refactors‚Äîbut only if you **constrain the graph**. This is exactly how the big leagues make it work (centralized source of truth + strict tooling). ([Google Research][5])

## Quick checklist you can paste into an issue

* [ ] Create `packages/` with workspace tooling enabled
* [ ] Add ESLint `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` with tags & constraints
* [ ] Add TS Project References across all packages
* [ ] Add `CODEOWNERS` per bounded context
* [ ] CI: lint + type-check + affected graph + fail on violations
* [ ] Forbid deep imports via `"exports"` and lint rules
* [ ] Optional: Bazel `visibility` on sensitive targets
* [ ] Document contracts in small `@renderx/contracts/*` packages
* [ ] Flip boundary rules from warn ‚Üí error once migration stabilizes

## The JSON Template:

This JSON file (`renderx-plugins-demo-adf.json`) is *perfectly positioned* to drive your **mono-repo structure** and **enforce context boundaries**.

Think of it as a **RenderX Architectural Definition File (ADF)** ‚Äî a living, declarative contract for how your repo is organized, validated, and orchestrated.
Here‚Äôs how you can enhance it to become the *blueprint* for the mono-repo:

---

### üß© 1. Add a `"workspace"` or `"monoRepo"` section

Define how each context maps to a package inside the mono-repo.

```json
"monoRepo": {
  "root": "packages/",
  "packageManager": "pnpm",
  "contexts": [
    {
      "id": "host-app",
      "path": "packages/host-app",
      "scope": "host",
      "enforces": ["no-plugin-deps", "only-public-interfaces"]
    },
    {
      "id": "plugin-system",
      "path": "packages/host-sdk",
      "scope": "sdk",
      "enforces": ["no-ui-deps"]
    },
    {
      "id": "plugin-canvas",
      "path": "packages/plugins/canvas",
      "scope": "plugin"
    },
    {
      "id": "plugin-library",
      "path": "packages/plugins/library",
      "scope": "plugin"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can later generate:

* `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
* `tsconfig.references.json`
* `CODEOWNERS`
* Nx or Lint rulesets
  directly from this section.

---

### üß± 2. Embed dependency and visibility rules

Add a `"rules"` section that defines **what contexts may depend on what**:

```json
"rules": {
  "dependencies": [
    { "from": "plugin-*", "to": "host-app", "allowed": false },
    { "from": "plugin-*", "to": "plugin-system", "allowed": true },
    { "from": "plugin-*", "to": "orchestration-engine", "allowed": true },
    { "from": "host-app", "to": "plugin-*", "allowed": true },
    { "from": "sdk", "to": "*", "allowed": false }
  ],
  "lint": {
    "enforceModuleBoundaries": true,
    "checkDeepImports": true
  }
}
```

These can feed a **RenderX validator CLI** or **Valence rule plugin** that scans imports, TypeScript references, or build graphs to flag violations.

---

### üß™ 3. Extend `"metrics"` to track context health

Add metrics like:

```json
"metrics": {
  "contextBoundaryViolations": 0,
  "buildGraphIntegrity": "pass",
  "packageConsistency": "synced",
  "workspaceValidation": "clean"
}
```

These can be automatically updated by CI.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Integrate build orchestration

Your existing `buildSystem` block already has Vite and scripts.
Extend it for **multi-package build orchestration**:

```json
"buildSystem": {
  "type": "vite",
  "builder": "turbo",
  "pipelines": {
    "build": ["lint", "typecheck", "test", "bundle"],
    "release": ["build", "publish"]
  }
}
```

---

### üß† 5. Generate and enforce structure programmatically

With this schema in place, you can:

* Auto-generate `packages/` folders.
* Create manifest stubs and `package.json` per context.
* Apply lint and CI rules dynamically.
* Render dependency graphs (C4-style) straight from the JSON.
  *(Valence CIA or your own RenderX CLI can be the enforcer here.)*

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Connect it to CI/CD

Each PR could:

* Parse this file.
* Validate workspace graph consistency.
* Block merges that break context boundaries or dependency rules.
