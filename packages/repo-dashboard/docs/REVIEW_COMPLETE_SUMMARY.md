## Key Findings

### Problems Identified (7 Major Issues)

1. **Hardcoded Team Mappings** ❌
   - Location: `src/services/metrics-aggregator.ts` (lines 45-56)
   - Impact: Not scalable, breaks architecture-first principle

2. **Mock Data Generation** ❌
   - 7+ services generate synthetic data instead of fetching live data
   - Impact: Dashboard shows fake metrics

3. **Missing Team Association in ADF** ❌
   - `renderx-plugins-demo-adf.json` lacks `team` field
   - Impact: ADF cannot be source of truth for teams

4. **Services Don't Use ADF for Team Mapping** ❌
   - Services try to extract team info that doesn't exist
   - Impact: Forces hardcoded mappings as workaround

5. **Web UI Doesn't Call Services** ❌
   - Server makes direct GitHub API calls instead of using services
   - Impact: Services are unused code

6. **No Service-Specific API Endpoints** ❌
   - Missing 8+ endpoints to call services with architecture context
   - Impact: No way to invoke services from web UI

7. **Services Architecture is Disconnected** ❌
   - Services exist but are not integrated into data flow
   - Impact: Dashboard is not service-driven

### Positive Findings (2 Working Services)

1. **Pull Request Metrics Collector** ✅
   - Already fetches live data from GitHub API
   - Proof that live data integration works

2. **Deployment Metrics Collector** ✅
   - Already fetches live data from GitHub API
   - Can be used as reference implementation

## Solution: Phase 2.3 Overview

### 7 Implementation Phases

| Phase | Task | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|
| 2.3.1 | Update ADF Schema | 2h |
| 2.3.2 | Create ADFTeamMapper Service | 4h |
| 2.3.3 | Wire Services to Live Data | 12h |
| 2.3.4 | Create API Endpoints | 6h |
| 2.3.5 | Update Web UI | 6h |
| 2.3.6 | Update Metrics Aggregator | 4h |
| 2.3.7 | Update Cross-Team Services | 4h |
| Testing | Integration & QA | 6h |
| **Total** | | **44h** |

### Key Components to Create

1. **ADFTeamMapper Service** - Extract teams from ADF dynamically
2. **8 New API Endpoints** - Call services with architecture context
3. **Updated ADF Schema** - Add team associations to containers
4. **Live Data Services** - Replace mock data with GitHub API calls

### Services to Update

**Wire to Live Data** (7 services):
- build-status.ts
- test-coverage-collector.ts
- code-quality-collector.ts
- test-execution-collector.ts
- deployment-status.ts
- conductor-metrics-collector.ts
- bundle-metrics-collector.ts

**Update Team Mapping** (4 services):
- metrics-aggregator.ts
- cross-team-dependency.ts
- cross-team-communication.ts
- handoff-tracking.ts

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ All services pull live data from GitHub APIs (no mock data)
2. ✅ Team mappings are derived from ADF (no hardcoded mappings)
3. ✅ ADF has explicit team associations for each component
4. ✅ Web UI calls services with architecture context
5. ✅ All metrics are team-specific and architecture-aware
6. ✅ Dashboard displays only renderx-plugin repos
7. ✅ All 531+ tests pass
8. ✅ No console warnings about missing data

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Review GitHub Issue #101
2. Approve Phase 2.3 implementation plan
3. Create sub-issues for each phase

### Implementation Order
1. **Start with Phase 2.3.1** - Update ADF schema (foundation)
2. **Then Phase 2.3.2** - Create ADFTeamMapper (enables others)
3. **Parallel: Phase 2.3.3 & 2.3.4** - Wire services and create endpoints
4. **Finally: Phase 2.3.5** - Update Web UI (depends on all others)

### Timeline
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks for full implementation
- **Team Size**: 1-2 developers
- **Testing**: 1 week for integration and QA

## Related Work

### Completed
- **Issue #96**: Phase 2.2: Dashboard Enhancement (PR #100 - CI Passing)
  - 7 new React components
  - 1 new custom hook
  - 850+ lines of CSS
  - All 531 tests passing

### In Progress
- **Issue #101**: Phase 2.3: Architecture-Driven Live Data Integration (Just Created)

2. **ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary
3. **REVIEW_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md** - This document

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review completed
2. ✅ GitHub Issue #101 created
3. ✅ Analysis documents created
4. ⏭️ **Next**: Review and approve Issue #101
5. ⏭️ **Next**: Create sub-issues for each phase
6. ⏭️ **Next**: Begin Phase 2.3.1 implementation

## Conclusion

The repo-dashboard has a solid foundation with working services and ADF integration, but the architecture is not fully connected. Services are unused, team mappings are hardcoded, and mock data is pervasive. Phase 2.3 will transform the dashboard into a true architecture-driven system where:

- **ADF is the source of truth** for all repositories, teams, and relationships
- **All services pull live data** from GitHub APIs for renderx-plugin repos only
- **Teams are dynamically derived** from the ADF plugin architecture
- **Web UI properly calls services** with architecture context

This is a critical phase for achieving the architecture-first dashboard vision.
