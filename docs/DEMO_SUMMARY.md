## 🤖 Agent Pipeline Flow

```
🧠 Planner → 💻 Implementer → 🧪 Tester → 📦 Packager → ✅ Verifier → 🛡️ Guardrails
```

### Agent Responsibilities

1. **🧠 Planner Agent**
   - Analyzes feature requests
   - Decomposes into API spec, test plan, and dependencies
   - Generates implementation roadmap
   - Output: JSON plan for implementation

2. **💻 Implementer Agent**
   - Writes production-quality TypeScript code
   - Creates comprehensive unit tests
   - Generates README with usage examples
   - Output: Complete package implementation

3. **🧪 Tester Agent**
   - Runs unit tests with Vitest
   - Executes E2E tests with Playwright
   - Proposes fixes for failures
   - Output: Test results and coverage reports

4. **📦 Packager Agent**
   - Builds distributable tarball
   - Generates package metadata
   - Calculates hashes for verification
   - Output: `.tgz` artifact with metadata

5. **✅ Verifier Agent**
   - Creates temporary test project
   - Installs package as external dependency
   - Runs smoke tests
   - Verifies exports and types
   - Output: Installation verification report

6. **🛡️ Guardrails Agent**
   - Validates package structure
   - Checks naming conventions
   - Scans for heavy dependencies
   - Verifies exports and types
   - Output: Compliance report

## 🎥 Cinematic Logging Features

### Enhanced CI Workflow
The GitHub Actions workflow now includes:

1. **Visual Banners**: Each agent has a distinctive banner with box-drawing characters
2. **Progress Indicators**: Clear status messages for each step
3. **Structured Output**: Organized logs for easy reading and video recording
4. **Quality Gate Tracking**: Explicit G1-G6 gate status in logs
5. **Final Summary**: Comprehensive report with all results

### Example Banner
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                  🧪 TESTER AGENT - UNIT (G2)               ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🧪 Running unit tests with Vitest...
🔬 Testing all functions and edge cases...
```

## 🚀 Pull Request

**PR #18**: [🎬 Agentic Pipeline Demo - Complete Implementation](https://github.com/BPMSoftwareSolutions/package-builder/pull/18)

The PR includes:
- Complete implementation details
- Test results for all quality gates
- Agent pipeline flow diagram
- Next steps for video production
- Ready for review and merge

---

## 🎬 Next Steps (Optional)

### For Video Production
1. Record screen capture of CI workflow running
2. Sync with Luke Bryan's "Play It Again" soundtrack
3. Highlight each agent's banner and progress
4. Show final "All Gates Green" summary

### For Externalization
1. Trigger the externalization workflow manually:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run externalize-package.yml \
     -f package_path=packages/svg-editor \
     -f new_repo_name=tiny-svg-editor \
     -f visibility=public
   ```
2. This will create a new `tiny-svg-editor` repository
3. Package will be ready for npm publishing

### For Documentation
1. Create blog post about the agentic pipeline
2. Document the agent architecture
3. Share demo video on social media
4. Update README with demo link
