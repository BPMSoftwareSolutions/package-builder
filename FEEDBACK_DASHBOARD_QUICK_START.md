# 🎯 Real-Time Feedback Dashboard - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Phase 1.9.1 of the repo-dashboard now includes a complete **Real-Time Feedback Dashboard** with 5 main components:

1. **Feedback Summary Card** - Overall health score (0-100) with trend
2. **Alerts Panel** - All active alerts with severity filtering
3. **Build Status Card** - Build status with flakiness detection
4. **Test Results Panel** - Test results with coverage tracking
5. **Deployment Status Card** - Deployment status with rollback tracking

## 🚀 How to Access the Features

### Step 1: Start the Dashboard
```bash
cd packages/repo-dashboard
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open in Browser
- Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 3: Click the Feedback Menu
In the top navigation bar, you'll see:
```
📊 Dashboard | Architecture | Metrics | Insights | 📡 Feedback | Repositories | Issues | Packages | ⚙️ Settings
```

**Click on "📡 Feedback"** to access the Real-Time Feedback Dashboard

## 📊 What You'll See

## 🎓 Related to The Phoenix Project

This implementation addresses flow problems identified in The Phoenix Project by:
- Providing real-time visibility into build, test, and deployment status
- Enabling quick identification of bottlenecks and issues
- Supporting 42 backend services for comprehensive metrics
- Implementing the Three Ways framework (Flow, Feedback, Learning)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No data showing?**
- Verify organization and repository names are correct
- Check that backend services are running
- Ensure WebSocket connection is established

**Real-time updates not working?**
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify backend WebSocket server is running
- Dashboard will fall back to polling if WebSocket fails

**Styling issues?**
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check that CSS variables are properly defined
- Ensure dark mode CSS is loaded
